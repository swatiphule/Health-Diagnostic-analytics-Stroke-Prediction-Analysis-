I have done the project named Stoke Prediction Analysis of the Human beings. I have performed this project by using Exploratory Data analysis , Machine Learning algorithmns and Visualizations.
The Objectives of Stroke Prediction analysis is to apply the computational methods using machine learning techniques to predict the stroke from the dataset.ie to find insights in the various factors using ML techniques.
In future studies , we aim to use data that reflects different types of insights for the stroke to be caused by using Descriptive and Diagnostic Analysis and predict for the future.I concluded that we can use Various Machine Learning techniques are used to predict the stroke of the person.
